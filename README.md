# Nonstop BGM

This is a client-side tModLoader mod that lets music continue to play when alt-tabbed. Music volume can also be lowered when out of focus (configurable).

You can yell at me through [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3462926470) or Github if you experience issues or mod incompatibilities.
